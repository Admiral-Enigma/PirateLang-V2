# PirateLang-V2
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DemSquirrel/PirateLang-V2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DemSquirrel/PirateLang-V2)  
Small and fun programming language

# TODO
1. Make IS (interactive shell)
2. Plugin for editors
3. Make it more pirate like
4. Add some form of grapics api

#Install:
To install Piratelang you will need to have nodejs installed on your computer, when you have that run this command

     npm i piratelang -g
now you can run your programs by typing

     pirate -f file.txt


# Exsample code:
This code will make a function called varTOeet which  adds 1337 to the input value which is a variable called scrub and on the last line we print the new value out

    do(
     define(makeLeet, fun(varTOleet, +(varTOleet,  1337))),
     define(scrub, 420),
     ahoy(makeLeet(scrub))
     )
     output: 1757
